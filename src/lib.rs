/**

# Overview
**rawsock** is a Rust library that highly simplifies use of packet capturing libraries
such as **pcap**, **wpcap** or **pf_ring** and also libraries with a compatible API, such as **npcap**.
It can help you to send and receive raw socket frames using one consistent API for all those libraries,
so that the internal complexity is hidden.

Main advantage: you write code using one simple API - rawsock. But when your application is run,
the best available library on user's machine is chosen and used in the background.
Platform-specific extensions (such as WinPcap ```pcap_sendqueue_transmit()```) are also used in optimal way.

# Main features

* One consistent API for all packet capturing libraries.
* Support of pcap, wpcap (with Windows-specific optimizations), npcap and pfring
* Supports all main platforms: tested on Windows, Linux, Mac. Many more should work too
* Libraries are loaded in a dynamic manner, so that the library does not have any direct
    dependency - it's going to work with whatever is available on the given platform.
* Libraries are checked in the order of effectiveness. The best found library is loaded.
* It is also possible to load a specific library when using the rawsock API
or directly use the API of the given dynamically loaded library - for more advanced use cases.

# Quick example

```no_run
extern crate rawsock;
use rawsock::open_best_library;

const ICMP_PACKET: [u8; 84] = [

0x08, 0x08, 0x08, 0x08, 0x08, 0x00, 0x2f, 0x08, 0x66, 0xc2, 0x00, 0x12, 0x82, 0xaa, 0xcc, 0x5c,

0x24, 0x25, 0x26, 0x27, 0x28, 0x29, 0x2a, 0x2b, 0x2c, 0x2d, 0x2e, 0x2f, 0x30, 0x31, 0x32, 0x33,
0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37];

fn main() {

    /*
